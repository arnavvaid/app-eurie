## Usage
- Download ZIP folder from the GitHub repository
- Run the server through the terminal via the command: 'python3 ./chatProgramServer.py', this will prompt the user for the IP theyre hosting on and the port e.g '192.168.1.100:PORT' where PORT belongs to the range 8000-49151
- and the same for the client 'python3 ./chatProgramClient.py', this will then prompt the user for the URL to connect to. this is of the form: 'ws://localhost:PORT'
### The user can then select from several commands
- "Who's online?" (returns a list of connected parties)
- "Send a public message" (prompts the user to send a message to all connected parties) 
- "Send a private message" (prompts the user to send a message to a particular connected party) 
- "Sign off" (closes connection and shuts down)
